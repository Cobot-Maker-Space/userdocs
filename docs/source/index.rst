Health & Safety
===============
University of Nottingham health & safety policies apply. Some studies or experiments with the robots may need additional risk assessments, email info@cobotmakerspace.org to discuss further if you think that this may be the case.

First Aid
=========
If you or someone else require first aid, refer to the first aid contact sheet in the entrance of the Nottingham Geospatial Building. There is a first aid kit mounted on the wall near the front door of the robot lab. Any incidents should be reported through the University of Nottingham incident reporting system. In an emergency, contact security on 0115 951 8888 (or extension 18888).


Heating & Cooling
=================
In the main lab, there are two electric heaters, and three air conditioning (cooling only) units. These are all individually controlled by thermostats on the wall. The heaters are programmed to come on automatically between 08:00 and 18:00 on weekdays and maintain the temperature at 21Â°c. The air conditioning units need to be powered on manually if needed. Instructions for temporary adjustments for when you are too hot/cold are given by the thermostats. Heating and cooling in the Living Space is controlled by the building HVAC system.
