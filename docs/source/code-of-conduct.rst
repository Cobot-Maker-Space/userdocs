Code of Conduct
===============

In order to keep the Cobot Maker Space welcoming and useful to all of its users, there are a few simple guidelines that must be observed.

- Opening hours are 8am to 6pm Monday to Friday (excluding Bank Holidays). No access outside these times unless arranged via: info@cobotmakerspace.org.
- Lab bays, the Ward Room, and the Museum Room must be booked prior to use via: https://booking.cobotmakerspace.org.
- The workshop area and the Living Space are available for ad-hoc use unless booked out. Do not use these areas if they have been booked out. Bookings can be made and checked via: https://booking.cobotmakerspace.org.
- Equipment must be booked prior to use via: https://booking.cobotmakerspace.org.
- If you need to leave equipment in the space, it must be placed in one of the boxes provided and labelled with identifying information (your name, project name, etc.). If it will not fit in a box, it must still be labelled. Unlabelled items are at risk of being disposed of.
- When setting up equipment, consider how best to set up so that multiple users can make use of the space with minimal impact on one another.
- The lab has been designed to be reconfigurable so equipment and furniture can be rearranged according to your needs, but after use must be put back into the default configuration as depicted in the diagrams in this document.
- Beware of creating hazards. Use tape or cable runners to cover trailing cabled. Always keep floor boxes closed and prefer use of the ceiling mounted sockets.
- Always clean up after yourself. Cleaning equipment is available.
- Equipment is for use only in the Cobot Maker Space and must not be removed.
- Equipment must be returned after use in the same condition as prior to use, including all power supplies, cables, and other accessories.
- Report all faults or damage to equipment and infrastructure via: info@cobotmakerspace.org.
- Do not make any changes to hardware or software without permission. If changes are required contact: info@cobotmakerspace.org.
- Authorised access only, contact info@cobotmakerspace.org for further queries.
- For security purposes, do not leave windows or doors open/unattended and ensure blinds are closed when you leave. Do not exit via the external fire doors.
